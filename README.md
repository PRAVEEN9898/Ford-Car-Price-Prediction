# Ford-Car-Price-Prediction
"Predictive modeling for Ford car prices using various machine learning algorithms, offering insights for strategic pricing decisions."

This project aims to estimate Ford car prices based on various parameters, providing valuable insights for pricing strategies. The dataset includes information such as model, year, transmission, mileage, fuel type, tax, mpg, engine size, and the target variable: price. Multiple machine learning algorithms, including Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), have been applied to achieve accurate predictions.
